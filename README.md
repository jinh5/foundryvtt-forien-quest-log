**NOTE** This is an unofficial forked version of the module maintained by the [League of Foundry Developers](https://discord.gg/gzemMfHURH) to provide module continuity while Forien is unavailable.

**[Compatibility]**: *FoundryVTT* 0.8.6 (as of version 0.6.0)

**[Systems]**: *any*  

**[Languages]**: *Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Swedish*  

This module provides comprehensive Quest Log system for players and Game Masters to use with Foundry Virtual Table Top

## Installation

1. Install Forien's Quest Log from the Foundry Module browser directly, or manually using manifest URL: https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-quest-log/releases/latest/download/module.json
2. While loaded in World, enable **_Forien's Quest Log_** module.

## Usage
Button to access Quest Log is situated on the bottom of Journal Directory or in the scene controls menu under notes/journal entries. There are two controls related to Quest Log- Pen opens the Quest Log proper, and bookmark icon opens Floating Window that displays quests in fashion similar to MMORPG games.

I think module is quite user-friendly with intuitive UI, however if you are confused and lost, you might want to [check out Wiki](https://github.com/Forien/foundryvtt-forien-quest-log/wiki) or most recent [Release Video](https://www.patreon.com/forien/posts?filters[tag]=quest%20log&filters[media_types]=video).


## Features

* Quest Log windows that lists all quests divided into `In Progress`, `Completed` and `Failed` tabs
* Quest creator with WYSIWYG editors for description and GM notes
* Quest objectives
* Draggable Item rewards
* Fully editable Quest Details window
* Personal Quests
* Quest Branching in the form of Sub Quests

## Macros & Syntax

FQL provides macros for the convenience of GMs and players to make controlling FQL easier and providing an option besides opening module setting and copy/pasting commands from wiki. They can be added by dragging and dropping to the hotbar.

Syntax Examples:

Opens FQL
```
Hooks.call('ForienQuestLog.Open.QuestLog');
```

Resets the quest tracker position if hidden by window / size changes
```
game.settings.set('forien-quest-log', 'resetQuestTracker', true);
```

This macro opens a FilePicker for the GM to select the default image assigned to new abstract rewards created in quests
```
new FilePicker({
   type: 'image',
   callback: async (path) =>
   {
      await game.settings.set('forien-quest-log', 'defaultAbstractRewardImage', path);
   },
}).browse();
```

This macro runs all DB migration
The integer parameter (0 default) can be set to run a specific migration level to max level migration
```
Hooks.call('ForienQuestLog.Run.DBMigration', 0);
```

## Future plans (current ideas)

Plans for future include:
* a toggle "hide future tasks from players"
* Chapter/Arc system
* draggable EXP/Money rewards (need to wait for FVTT 0.7.0)

## Translations

If you are interested in translating my module, simply make a new Pull Request with your changes, or contact me on Discord.

#### How to translate

I maintain both English and Polish translation of this module, so you check on those two to see how translation file can look like. It can be either expanded (nested) JSON like English, or flat JSON like Polish.

Order of Localization Strings inside a `.json` file is indifferent. 

Localization file **must be** either completely flat, or completely expanded (nested). Not partially both. 

#### What is `missing` Folder?

The `lang/missing/` folder contains files for all languages showing all Localization Strings that are in the Module, but are not covered by that Language. For example, there are 6 strings not covered by Polish language, but since they are simply `API Error` messages, there is no need.
